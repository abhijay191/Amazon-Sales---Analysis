# 📊 Amazon Superstore Sales Dashboard (2011–2014)

I developed this interactive and data-rich Power BI dashboard project to analyze **Amazon Superstore sales data** over a 4-year period (2011–2014). The objective was to derive meaningful insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends, and to present these findings through an interactive, clean, and business-ready dashboard.

This project replicates a **real-world Business Intelligence workflow**, starting from data cleaning in Excel, defining and calculating KPIs, modeling data in Power BI, and finally building an insightful, executive-level dashboard using **DAX** and **data storytelling techniques**.
